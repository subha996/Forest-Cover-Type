## Problem Statement 
The government is used to employ officers for inspection of the various region to find the Forest cover type are present in a specific region. This process needs a huge amount of manpower, time along money. They have to visit the forest regions manually and have to inspect them to Label them the Forest type for that region. They have collected various geographical information like Elevation, Aspect, and it was observed that the forest type is dependent on this information. It was found that there is some strong relation between collected information and the Forest Cover labels. 
It was our Project to build a classification methodology to build a system that will be able to predict Forest Cover type based on geographical information.
